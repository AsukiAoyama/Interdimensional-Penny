        <h4>Interdimensional-Penny</h4>
        <p>On March 30, 1980, Dean Patrick Carter strolled through
        the bustling streets of New York City, when a series of captivating
        flashes emanated from a secluded alleyway, luring his attention. 
        Intrigued, he ventured closer and discovered a lone penny resting
        on the ground. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that 
        this unassuming coin hailed from the future, bearing the year 2005.
        Astonishingly, when Carter tossed the penny into the air, it defied 
        conventional expectations by manifesting six distinct states. Recognizing
        its profound significance, Carter aptly christened it the "Interdimensional-
        Penny, a fascinating artifact that blurred the boundaries of time and reality.</p>

        <h4>How to use?</h4>
        <p>If the coin is tossed, it will end up in one of six
        possible states. The possible states are Heads, Tails, 
        Edge, Heads-Negative, Tails-Negative and Edge-Negative.
        The negative values are the inner sides of the coin. 
        Since this coin can seemingly change the rules of space-time
        at will, it is also possible to see the inside of it. 
        You can flip the penny by simply clicking it.</p>
